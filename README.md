# Volume-OSD-y
This AutoHotkey script has two functions:
* It captures `Volume_Up` and `Volume_Down` keypresses and makes the volume change exponentially instead of linearly.
* And since I couldn't find a way of making the original OSD (left) then show up, it also displays displays a window that imitates it (right).

## Other hotkeys
`Win+J` reloads the script, which is useful when editing it.
